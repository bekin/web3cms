
         Upgrading Instructions for Web3CMS v1.0.X.rY
         ============================================

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The following upgrading instructions are cumulative. That is,
if you want to upgrade from version A to version C and there is
version B between A and C, you need to following the instructions
for both A and B.

Upgrading from v1.0.X.rY
------------------------
- We are still far from the finished environment.
  Need to replace all files.




Upgrading from one version of Yii Framework to another on your own
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Open and compare framework/web/helpers/CHtml.php of both Yii versions,
  open web3cms/protected/components/_CHtml.php, check all methods defined in it,
  following instructions in comments and when necessary, copy code
  from newer CHtml into _CHtml.
  If no method from _CHtml changed in newer CHtml, then you don't have to modify _CHtml.

- Open web3cms/protected/models/UserLoginForm.php, check __construct() method,
  compare framework/web/CFormModel.php of both Yii versions,
  if parameters of __construct() in CFormModel were changed, then
  change it accordingly in UserLoginForm. Currently it is
  __construct($attributes=array(),$scenario='')
  parent::__construct($attributes,$scenario);
  95% that you won't need to do anything here.

- Open web3cms/protected/components/_CWebUser.php, check restoreFromCookie() method,
  compare framework/web/auth/CWebUser.php of both Yii versions,
  if restoreFromCookie() in CFormModel were changed, then
  change it accordingly in UserLoginForm.
  97% that you won't need to do anything here.

- Open framework/web/auth/CBaseUserIdentity.php of both Yii versions,
  open web3cms/protected/components/_CUserIdentity.php, make sure
  than no constants from _CUserIdentity have the same value as constants
  in CBaseUserIdentity. If there is a match, simple change value of constant
  in _CUserIdentity, e.g.
  const ERROR_IS_NOT_ADMINISTRATOR=12;
  to
  const ERROR_IS_NOT_ADMINISTRATOR=23;
  99% that you won't need to do anything here.

- Do the same with web3cms/protected/components/W3.php t() and
  framework/YiiBase.php t() - make sure that parameters in both functions
  are the same, and if necessary - update W3::t().
